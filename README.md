* Tutorial
  - Sign up
    -- Navigate to the root page, and click "Sign up"

  - Add a Movie
    -- Fill in the fields to add a movie.  Title is required, and note is optional.

  - Edit a Movie
    -- Click on "Edit Movie" and it will take you to a page to edit the movie where you can change the title, note, or even give it tags!

  - Mark as watched or UNwatched
    -- To help you keep track of which movies you have watched or not watched, there is a lovely button which allows you to do that, and greys out the watched movies, while your unwatched movies are still in white.

  - Filtering
    -- You can filter by typing into the filter box, or by clicking on the "show only my watched" or "show only my UNwatched" buttons.  You can also sort your list of movies, alphabetically. You can also click on any tags, and that will take you to a page where all the movies have been filtered by that tag!
